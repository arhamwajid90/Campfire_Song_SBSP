# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I call this one, the campfire song song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum...
NOW LET US SING ALONG
THREE
TWO
ONE
WE LOVE THE CAMPFIRE SONG
